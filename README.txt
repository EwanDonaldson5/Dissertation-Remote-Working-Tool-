This project was my dissertation for my fourth year at university. I was tasked with taking my own idea through the entire software development proccess to have a peice of documented software that I could demonstrate from my own machine. i chose to develop a remote working tool that was oriented around the employee rather than the organisation. I chose this due to the increase in remote workers triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. Also because typical tools attempt to make the employee productive for the benefit of
the company while at the cost of the employee. To combat this I developed software to allow the user to effectively work with fellow employees while also granting the ability of reviewing their own efficiency. To understand this project further the write-up document is attached in the root folder of this repository. Also a video demonstration will be attached in the same location.

This is not a deployable version for the following reasons;
1. The project was developed in Java ANT so some of the required project libraries aren't included.
2. The Apache web server must be installed and setup on your machine.
3. phpMyAdmin must be setup on your web server (allowing for a local database).

Notes:
- The images folder of the application is included seperately from the project folder.
- To operate the Dropbox feature a new account must be made for each company.
- This accounts access code should be inserted/updated into dropbox.java file.
- The link used in the downloading aspect of the feature should also be updated to match the new Dropbox account.
